Easily debug WordPress sites using Ray.

== Description ==

[Ray](https://myray.app) is a beautiful, lightweight desktop app that helps you debug your app. There's a [free demo](https://myray.app) available that can be unlocked with a [license](https://spatie.be/products/ray).

After installing this plugin, you can use the `ray()` function to quickly dump stuff. Any variable(s) that you pass to `ray()` will be displayed.

Here some examples:

`
ray('Hello world');

ray(['a' => 1, 'b' => 2])->color('red');

ray('multiple', 'arguments', 'are', 'welcome');

ray()->showQueries();
`

There are many other helper functions available on Ray that allow you to display things that can help you debug such as [runtime and memory usage](https://spatie.be/docs/ray/v1/usage/framework-agnostic-php-project#measuring-performance-and-memory-usage), [queries that were executed](https://spatie.be/docs/ray/v1/usage/wordpress#showing-queries), and much more.
